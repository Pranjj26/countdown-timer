# Countdown Timer using Python and Tkinter

This is a simple countdown timer application built using Python and Tkinter. It allows the user to set a specific time duration and counts down until the time is up. When the timer reaches zero, a message box will be displayed indicating that the time is up.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. This code is compatible with Python 3.

## Installation

1. Create a new Python file and save it with a `.py` extension (e.g., `countdown_timer.py`).
2. Install the `tkinter` library if it's not already installed. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install tk
```

## Usage

To use the countdown timer application:

1. Open the Python file (`countdown_timer.py`) in a text editor or IDE.
2. Run the script using Python.

The countdown timer window will appear. Enter the desired duration in hours, minutes, and seconds in the respective fields. Click the "Set Time Countdown" button to start the timer. The window will update every second, showing the remaining time. When the timer reaches zero, a message box will pop up displaying the message "Time's up."


## Customization

Feel free to customize the appearance and behavior of the countdown timer according to your needs. You can modify the window size, font styles, button text, or add additional functionality as required.
